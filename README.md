# RadioJavanDLG
Radio Javan Download Link Generator

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command installs all the necessary libraries for the program, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.
To use the program, you need to run the main.py file. You can do this by entering the following command in the terminal:

python main.py <URL>
  In this command, <URL> should be the URL of one of the following:

    Playlist URL
    Podcast URL
    Album URL
    Artist URL
    Song URL
    Music Video URL

After entering the URL, the program retrieves the relevant information from the RadioJavan website and saves it in text files. For each type of URL, a corresponding text file is created with the appropriate naming. For example, for a Playlist URL, a file called links.txt is created in the corresponding folder.
